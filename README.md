# Persona-Bench

**CSC 699 — AI Safety Benchmark "Social World"**

## The Big Picture

We're building a test to see if an AI can figure out who someone is just by reading their text messages and calendar.

To do that, we need fake people with realistic lives. This pipeline creates those fake people step by step, starting from basic demographics and ending with a full life profile and social circle.

## Why This Exists

The end goal (Steps 4-7, future work) is to:
1. Take a fake person's profile
2. Generate realistic app logs (text messages, calendar events) that show their daily life
3. Hide facts about the person inside those logs using behavioral clues (e.g., never say "has diabetes" — instead show daily glucose checks, food adjustments, doctor appointments)
4. Ask an AI: "Based on these logs, what can you figure out about this person?"
5. Score how well the AI does

**Steps 1-3 (this repo)** build the fake people. Steps 4-7 will test the AI.

## The Pipeline: What Each Step Does

### Step 1: Get a Starter Person

**What:** Pull a basic person from NVIDIA's dataset of 6 million fake Americans.

**What you get:** A JSON file with bare-bones info — name, age, gender, job, city, education, plus short paragraphs about their professional life, sports interests, arts interests, travel style, food preferences, and cultural background.

**Example:** Mary Alberti, 28, female, fast food worker, Madison WI, high school education, Italian-American, Catholic upbringing.

**That's it.** This is just a starting point. The person is flat — a sketch, not a character.

### Step 2: Interview the Person

**What:** We give Claude the starter person and say: "You are this person. Answer 109 life-history interview questions as them."

**Why 109 questions?** They come from a Stanford research paper (Park et al. 2024) that interviewed 1,000 real people. The questions cover everything: childhood, family, work, health, religion, politics, finances, daily routine, relationships, hopes, values.

**What you get:** Two things in one file:

1. **The transcript** — The full Q&A. 109 questions, each with 2-3 follow-ups. This is the raw interview, like a recording.

2. **The extracted profile** — A compressed summary of everything important from the interview, organized into categories so downstream steps can use it. Think of it like cliff notes of the interview.

**Why do we need the extracted profile?** Because the interview is LONG (hundreds of Q&As). Steps 3-7 can't re-read the whole thing every time. The extracted profile is the portable, structured version.

**What's inside the extracted profile:**

| Section | What it is | Why it exists |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Demographics** | Name, age, gender, location, education, job | Basic identity header |
| **Preferences** (15 categories) | Health, food, travel, social life, home, entertainment, hobbies, work, arts, sports, nature, tech, community, music, fashion | Everything the person likes, does, and chooses — organized by life domain. Each has a summary, specific behavioral details, and Q## citations back to the interview. |
| **Summaries** (4 experts) | Demographer, Behavioral Economist, Political Scientist, Psychologist | Four different expert lenses analyzing the same person. The demographer looks at life stage and social status. The economist looks at how they make decisions. The political scientist looks at civic engagement. The psychologist looks at personality and coping patterns. |
| **Others/Misc** (6 subcategories) | Cultural practices, life events, physical context, media diet, tech tools, unresolved items | Catch-all for important info that doesn't fit into the 15 preference categories or 4 summaries. Has strict rules for what goes where. |

**Critical rule:** For sensitive topics (health, religion, politics), the person describes BEHAVIORS, never labels. They say "I check my levels three times a day" not "I have diabetes." This is because later (Steps 4-7), we'll hide these facts in app logs and the AI has to figure them out from behavioral clues alone.

### Step 2b: Verify and Correct the Profile

**What:** Four AI experts review the interview and check for mistakes. Then they FIX them.

**Why:** Step 2 is doing a lot — role-playing a person AND compressing their life into a structured profile. Things get dropped, contradicted, or misplaced. Step 2b catches that.

**The 4 checks (directions):**

1. **Seed vs Interview** — Did the interview contradict the original NVIDIA data? (e.g., seed says age 28, interview says 30)
2. **Interview vs Profile** — Did the extracted profile accurately capture what was said? (e.g., person talked about gardening in Q17 but it's missing from hobbies)
3. **Profile vs Itself** — Does the profile contradict itself? (e.g., summaries say she's frugal but preferences say she shops at expensive stores)
4. **Completeness** — Is anything from the interview missing from the ENTIRE profile? (e.g., person mentioned a brother in Q05 but he appears nowhere)

**What you get:** Two things:

1. **Verification report** — The accountability trail. Every issue found, how it was resolved.
2. **Corrected extracted profile** — The FIXED version of the profile with gaps filled, contradictions resolved, and expert summaries baked in. **This is the canonical profile that Step 3 uses.**

**File:** `data/step2b_verification/mary_alberti_verification.json`

### Step 3: Create Their Social Circle

**What:** Generate the 5 people closest to this person — family, friends, coworkers.

**Why:** Steps 4-7 need text message conversations. You can't have text messages without people to text. The social circle gives each person someone to talk to, with realistic relationships and shared interests.

**What you get:** 5 people, each with:
- Who they are (name, age, job, location)
- How they know the person (family? friend? coworker?)
- Their own personality and communication style
- What they do together
- What they've been texting about recently
- Q## evidence from the interview proving this relationship makes sense

**Rules:**
- At least 1 family member
- At least 1 friend outside work
- At least 1 work colleague (or community contact if retired/unemployed)
- Mix of ages, genders, backgrounds

**File:** `data/step3_social_circles/mary_alberti_social_circles.json`

---

### Step 3b: Verify the Social Circle

**What:** Check that the 5 generated people don't contradict the interview or the profile.

**Why:** Same reason as Step 2b. The AI generated these people — we need to make sure they make sense.

**2 checks:**
1. **Social circles vs Interview** — Does anything about these people contradict what was said?
2. **Social circles vs Profile** — Do shared activities match the person's actual preferences?

## How to Reproduce

See `REPRODUCIBILITY_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions.

Short version: For each persona, run the prompts in order (Step 2 → 2b → 3 → 3b), pasting in the previous step's output. All prompts are self-contained — just fill in the `{{placeholders}}` with actual data.
