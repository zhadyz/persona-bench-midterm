```

**Why this order?**
- Step 1 before 2: You cannot interview a blank slate. NVIDIA gives Census-aligned demographics so the interview starts from a realistic foundation.
- Step 2 before 3: You need to know someone's interests, religion, health, personality BEFORE you can determine who they'd realistically befriend.
- Step 3 before 4-5: Messenger conversations require knowing WHO this person talks to. Calendar needs to reflect group activities and social plans.
- Verify at each enrichment step: Park et al. showed automated schema checks miss contradictions that expert perspectives catch.

# STEP 1: SEED DATA FROM NVIDIA

## Source
**NVIDIA Nemotron-Personas-USA** (Hugging Face, CC BY 4.0, 6M synthetic personas)
- Built on a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) trained on US Census Bureau ACS data
- Joint distributions of age x sex x education x occupation x geography match real Census
- Includes narrative persona descriptions across 6 dimensions

## Our Seed: Mary Alberti

```
ID:         e7c0574639a244c8972c92aab9501035
Name:       Mary Alberti
Sex:        Female
Age:        28
Education:  High School
Occupation: Fast food / counter worker
City:       Madison, WI (53717)
Marital:    Never married
Country:    USA
```

**NVIDIA Narrative Fields (what makes this richer than raw demographics):**

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| **Professional Persona** | Front-line food service specialist with razor-sharp cash handling, inventory tracking, POS mastery. Disciplined, routine-driven work ethic. Calmly resolves high-pressure customer issues. Eyeing promotion to shift supervisor. |
| **Sports Persona** | 3-5 mile runs around Lake Mendota with Madison Runners Club. Roots for Wisconsin Badgers (basketball), Milwaukee Brewers (summer), never misses Green Bay Packers on Sundays. |
| **Arts Persona** | Lyrical storytelling of John Prine, atmospheric indie folk of Bon Iver, classic cinematography of Wes Anderson. Attends local art walks and museum exhibits. |
| **Travel Persona** | Planned weekend getaways: lakeside relaxation in Door County, culinary adventures in Napa Valley. Dreams of Kyoto trip. Balances travel costs with saving for future diner venture. |
| **Culinary Persona** | Intermediate culinary talent: cheddar-crusted bratwurst, cheese-curd poutine, spiced apple crumble. Fresh tomatoes, beans, herbs from raised-bed garden. Hosts low-key dinner gatherings. |
| **Core Persona** | Routine-obsessed, bullet-journal aficionado. Disciplined work ambition with competitive edge. Occasional craft-brew indulgence. Double-checks every receipt for hidden costs. |
| **Cultural Background** | Second-generation Italian-American raised in Madison, WI. Modest Catholic Midwestern upbringing. Sunday family meals with homemade pasta and Wisconsin cheese. Values outdoor recreation, farmers markets, modest living. |
| **Skills** | POS operation, cash handling, food safety, inventory management, team scheduling, customer service, multitasking, time management, shift leadership, problem solving |
| **Hobbies** | Bullet journaling, home cooking/baking, raised-bed gardening, running around Lake Mendota, reading self-help books, solving Sudoku puzzles, craft-brew tastings, listening to classic rock |
| **Career Goals** | Crew member → shift supervisor → restaurant manager → own small family-style diner. Plans: community college hospitality program + ServSafe certification. |

## Thought Process: Why This Specific Persona?

Mary is ideal for demonstrating the pipeline because:
1. **Rich cultural context**: Italian-American, Catholic, Midwestern — creates natural taboo/preference material
2. **Clear social life**: Running club, Packers watch parties, dinner gatherings — gives us social circle hooks
3. **Career ambition**: Shift supervisor goal creates workplace relationships for messenger logs
4. **Specific hobbies**: Gardening, bullet journaling, cooking — creates diverse but consistent calendar entries
5. **Financial constraint**: Fast food worker saving for a diner — creates realistic spending limits

# STEP 2: CREATE A RICH PERSONA VIA STANFORD INTERVIEW

## Source
Park et al. (2024) "Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People" — Table 7 (pages 60-64)

## Key Insight from the Paper
The full interview protocol is 99 questions across ~120 minutes. But the paper found that **only 20% of the interview time is enough to derive an enriched persona** — the rest provides diminishing returns. Park et al. showed interview-based agents achieved **85% normalized accuracy** vs 71% with demographics alone (Table 8).

## Question Selection: 30 Minutes (~1800 seconds)

**Selection criteria:**
- Questions that reveal persona across DIVERSE perspectives (not just demographics)
- Questions that elicit BEHAVIORAL details (not yes/no answers)
- Questions that naturally surface hidden taboos (health, religion, politics, conflicts)
- Questions that provide material for ALL downstream steps (social circles, messenger, calendar)

**Selected Questions from Table 7 (Stanford Interview Script):**

```
BLOCK 1: LIFE STORY (625 sec = 10.4 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q1: "Tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning —
     from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships,
     and to any major life events you may have had."
     [TIME: 625 sec — includes follow-ups]

     WHY: This is the foundation. It reveals family structure (parents
     for social circles), turning points (career path, moving to Madison),
     cultural identity (Italian-American traditions), and values (hard
     work, community) — all in one narrative arc. The long allocation
     ensures depth.

BLOCK 2: FAMILY & RELATIONSHIPS (415 sec = 6.9 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q2: "Let me ask you about the important people in your life. If you
     have a partner or children, tell me about them."
     [TIME: 310 sec]

     WHY: Directly maps to Step 3 (social circles). For Mary: unmarried,
     so this surfaces best friends, parents, siblings, romantic interests.

Q3: "Tell me about your immediate family that you haven't already
     mentioned."
     [TIME: 25 sec]

Q4: "Tell me about your friends, romantic partners, or anyone outside
     your family who has been an important part of your life."
     [TIME: 80 sec]

     WHY: Surfaces non-family social connections — running club friends,
     work colleagues, craft-brew tasting buddies. Essential for Step 3.

BLOCK 3: DAILY ROUTINE & WORK (105 sec = 1.75 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q5: "How do your days vary across a typical week?"
     [TIME: 105 sec]

     WHY: Reveals the actual daily schedule that Step 5 (calendar) will
     formalize. For Mary: work shifts, running routine, Sunday Packers
     ritual, Saturday farmers market.

BLOCK 4: HEALTH (225 sec = 3.75 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q6: "How would you describe your general health these days?"
     [TIME: 80 sec]

Q7: "What makes it easy or difficult to stay healthy?"
     [TIME: 65 sec]

Q8: "Were there any big health events in the past couple of years
     for you?"
     [TIME: 80 sec]

     WHY: These three questions form a health triangle that surfaces
     conditions INDIRECTLY. Mary won't say "I have X" — she'll say
     "I've been trying to cut back on sodium" or "My doctor said I
     need to keep an eye on my numbers." This creates the behavioral
     clues that become needle-facts in Step 4.

BLOCK 5: RELIGION & EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (270 sec = 4.5 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q9: "Tell me about your religion or spirituality, if that's a part
     of your life."
     [TIME: 155 sec]

     WHY: Mary's seed data says "Catholic upbringing." The interview
     reveals whether she's still practicing, lapsed, or evolved — and
     the behavioral markers (Sunday mass, Lenten observance, etc.)
     that become indirect calendar/messenger evidence.

Q10: "How have you been feeling over the past year?"
      [TIME: 115 sec]

      WHY: Reveals emotional landscape, stress levels, coping mechanisms.
      Maps to personality-driven behaviors (anxiety checking, journaling)
      and social support patterns.

BLOCK 6: FINANCES (155 sec = 2.6 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Q11: "What were your biggest expenses last month?"
      [TIME: 50 sec]

Q12: "How do you feel about your overall financial situation?"
      [TIME: 105 sec]

      WHY: For Mary (fast food worker saving for a diner), this reveals
      the financial constraint that becomes a hidden fact. "I try to
      keep fun spending under $200 a month" → Constraint-Financial.

TOTAL: 625 + 415 + 105 + 225 + 270 + 155 = 1,795 sec ≈ 30 minutes
```

## The Interview Prompt

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

You are an AI interviewer conducting a qualitative life-history interview
adapted from the American Voices Project protocol (Park et al., 2024).
Your subject is a synthetic persona. Conduct a multi-turn interview using
the questions below.

RULES:
1. Ask each question exactly as written, then ask 2-3 natural follow-ups
   based on the answer before moving to the next question.
2. The persona's answers MUST be consistent with the seed data provided.
3. Answers should be 3-6 sentences, conversational, and reveal behavioral
   details — NOT abstract statements.
4. For sensitive topics (health, religion, politics, finances), the persona
   should describe BEHAVIORS and HABITS, never clinical labels. For example:
   - Instead of "I have diabetes" → "I check my levels three times a day
     and try to watch my sugar intake"
   - Instead of "I'm Catholic" → "I still go to Mass most Sundays at
     St. Maria Goretti — it's where my family has gone since I was little"
   - Instead of "I'm liberal" → "I usually read NPR and follow a few
     local policy accounts on Twitter"
5. The persona should speak in a voice consistent with their age (28),
   education (high school), occupation (food service), and cultural
   background (Italian-American, Midwestern).

SEED DATA:
Name: Mary Alberti
Age: 28, Female, Never married
Education: High school

## Example Interview Output for Mary Alberti (Abbreviated)

```json
{
  "interview_transcript": [
    {
      "question": "Tell me the story of your life...",
      "answer": "Well, I grew up right here in Madison — my family's been here since my grandparents came over from Sicily in the sixties. My dad worked at Oscar Mayer for thirty years, and my mom ran the house and did bookkeeping for St. Maria Goretti. I'm the middle kid — older brother Tony who's a firefighter in Milwaukee now, and my little sister Gina who's finishing up at UW-Madison. I didn't do the college thing, honestly school wasn't really my strength. I started working at Culver's right out of high school and I've been in food service ever since. Right now I'm at a fast-casual place downtown, and I'm trying to work my way up to shift supervisor.",
      "follow_ups": [
        {
          "question": "What was it like growing up in an Italian-American household in Wisconsin?",
          "answer": "It was the best of both worlds honestly. Sunday dinners were mandatory — Nonna's sauce recipe, homemade pasta, everyone around the table. But we were also totally Midwestern — Friday fish fry, Packers on Sunday after church, that kind of thing. My dad always said we were Wisconsin first and Italian second, but then he'd turn around and argue about whether Nonna's meatballs were better than Zia Rosa's for like an hour."
        },
        {
          "question": "You mentioned school wasn't your strength. Can you tell me more about that?",
          "answer": "I just wasn't a classroom person. I'm more hands-on — I learn by doing. When I started working, that's when I found my thing. I'm really good at managing a rush, keeping inventory tight, handling cash. My manager says I'm the most organized person on the team. I've been looking into the hospitality program at Madison College, and I want to get my ServSafe manager cert this year."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about the important people in your life...",
      "answer": "My parents are still my rocks. Dad retired from Oscar Mayer a couple years ago and Mom still does the church bookkeeping. I talk to my mom almost every day — she calls me on my lunch break. My brother Tony, we're close but he's in Milwaukee so I see him maybe once a month when he comes back for Packers games. My best friend since middle school is Jess — Jessica Torres — she works at a dental office here in Madison. We run together three mornings a week with the Lake Mendota running club. And then there's my coworker Danny who I've been working with for two years now, he's like a brother to me at work."
    },
    {
      "question": "How would you describe your general health these days?",
      "answer": "Pretty good overall, I think. The running definitely helps — I do three to five miles a few times a week. My doctor did say my blood pressure has been a little on the high side at my last checkup, so I've been trying to cut back on salt. Which is hard when you work around food all day. I also notice I get pretty bad headaches when I eat certain things — my mom has the same thing, she can't do shellfish at all, and I think I might have inherited that because the last time I had shrimp at a fish fry I got really sick."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about your religion or spirituality...",
      "answer": "I was raised Catholic — baptism, first communion, confirmation, the whole deal at St. Maria Goretti. I still go to Mass most Sundays, partly because it's important to my mom and partly because I actually find it grounding. I'm not like super strict about it — I don't always make it to confession or anything — but I do the fish thing during Lent and I volunteer at the parish fish fry every year. It's more of a community thing for me than anything. My faith is more about the people and the traditions than the theology, if that makes sense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What were your biggest expenses last month?",
      "answer": "Rent is the big one — I split a two-bedroom with my friend Jess, so that's about $650 for my half. Then car payment, insurance, phone. After all the bills, I try to put $200 into my diner fund every month. For fun stuff, I keep it pretty tight — maybe $150 a month for going out, running shoes when I need them, craft brew tastings. I use my bullet journal to track every dollar."

## STEP 2 VERIFICATION: 4 Expert Views

### Source
Park et al. (2024) Section on Expert Reflection Module (pages 23-25). The paper uses 4 domain experts — **Psychologist, Behavioral Economist, Political Scientist, Demographer** — each generating 5-20 observations about the persona to catch domain-specific contradictions.

### Thought Process: Why These 4 Specific Experts?

| Expert | What They Catch That Others Miss |
|---|---|
| **Psychologist** | Personality-behavior mismatches (introvert at parties every night), emotional inconsistencies |
| **Behavioral Economist** | Financial impossibilities (fast food worker with $2000 leisure budget), irrational spending patterns |
| **Political Scientist** | Ideological contradictions (claims centrist but only consumes far-left media), civic behavior inconsistencies |
| **Demographer** | Demographic impossibilities (surgeon with HS diploma), age-inappropriate behaviors, cultural contradictions |

### The Expert Verification Prompt

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

You are a panel of 4 domain experts verifying a synthetic persona for
internal consistency, realism, and alignment with its seed data. You will
adopt each expert role in sequence and generate 5-15 observations per role.

IMPORTANT: Your job is to find CONTRADICTIONS and IMPLAUSIBILITIES, not
to praise the persona. Be rigorous. Check whether the enriched persona
(from the interview) is consistent with the NVIDIA seed data that was
used to generate it.

PERSONA SEED DATA (FROM NVIDIA — Step 1):
{nvidia_seed_data_json}

ENRICHED PERSONA (FROM INTERVIEW — Step 2):
{interview_extracted_profile_json}

FULL INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT:
{interview_transcript}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXPERT 1: PSYCHOLOGIST (PhD in Personality Psychology)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Imagine you are an expert psychologist taking notes while observing this
interview. Write 5-15 observations about the interviewee's psychological
traits, personality patterns, emotional regulation, coping mechanisms,
and interpersonal dynamics.

Specifically verify:
a) ROLE CONSISTENCY: Does the persona's behavior in the interview match
   the seed data's personality description? The seed says "routine-obsessed,
   disciplined work ambition, competitive edge, double-checks receipts."
   Does the interview show these traits consistently?

b) BEHAVIORAL COHERENCE: Are all described behaviors compatible with
   each other? For example:
   - A "routine-obsessed" person who also describes spontaneous adventures
     every weekend would be contradictory.
   - A person described as "calmly resolves high-pressure issues" who also
     describes frequent angry outbursts would be contradictory.

c) SOCIAL PATTERN: Is the described social life consistent with the
   person's personality? Someone described as having a "competitive edge"
   but who never describes any competitive activities would be a gap.

d) EMOTIONAL CONSISTENCY: Are the described stressors, coping mechanisms,
   and emotional states internally consistent?

Format each observation as:
"[OBSERVATION N]: {observation text}. [CONSISTENT/INCONSISTENT/GAP]
 Seed reference: {which seed field this relates to}
 Interview reference: {which answer this relates to}"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXPERT 2: BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIST (PhD in Behavioral Economics)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Imagine you are an expert behavioral economist taking notes while
observing this interview. Write 5-15 observations about the interviewee's
financial behaviors, spending patterns, savings habits, career trajectory,
and economic decision-making.

Specifically verify:
a) INCOME-EXPENSE PLAUSIBILITY: Does the described spending fit the
   income bracket? A fast food worker in Madison, WI likely earns
   $28k-$35k/year. Are rent ($650), car payment, savings ($200/mo for
   diner), and leisure ($150/mo) feasible on this income?

b) CAREER PATH REALISM: Is the described career trajectory plausible?
   "Crew → shift supervisor → manager → diner owner" — does the timeline
   and preparation (community college, ServSafe) make sense for someone
   who is 28 with a high school education?

c) FINANCIAL BEHAVIOR CONSISTENCY: Does the person's described financial
   personality (bullet journal tracking, receipt checking) match their
   described spending patterns?

d) CONSUMPTION PATTERNS: Are the described brands, stores, and spending
   habits consistent with the income level? (Napa Valley trips + saving
   for a diner on fast food wages — is this realistic or contradictory?)

Format: Same as Expert 1.

EXPERT 3: POLITICAL SCIENTIST (PhD in American Politics)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Imagine you are an expert political scientist taking notes while observing
this interview. Write 5-15 observations about the interviewee's political
views, civic engagement, media consumption, and ideological consistency.

Specifically verify:
a) IDEOLOGICAL COHERENCE: Are the described political views internally
   consistent? A Catholic Italian-American in Wisconsin who "votes for
   the person" — does her described media consumption and policy interests
   match this centrist/pragmatic positioning?

b) CIVIC BEHAVIOR: Is the described level of civic engagement consistent
   with her demographics and personality? (Voter registration, union
   membership/awareness in food service, community involvement)

c) MEDIA CONSUMPTION: Do the described news sources and social media
   usage patterns match the stated political leaning?

d) CULTURAL-POLITICAL ALIGNMENT: Is the intersection of Catholic faith,
   Italian-American heritage, Midwestern location, and working-class
   occupation consistent with the described political identity?

Format: Same as Expert 1.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXPERT 4: DEMOGRAPHER (PhD in Social Demography)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Imagine you are an expert demographer taking notes while observing this
interview. Write 5-15 observations about the interviewee's demographic
traits, household composition, employment status, educational attainment,
geographic context, and social mobility.

Specifically verify:
a) DEMOGRAPHIC PLAUSIBILITY: Are all demographic claims consistent?
   28-year-old, high school education, food service worker, Madison WI,
   never married — does everything described in the interview fit this
   profile?

b) HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION: Is the described living situation (splitting
   rent with friend Jess) plausible for a 28-year-old single woman in
   Madison, WI? Is the rent amount ($650 per half) realistic for that
   area?

c) EDUCATION-OCCUPATION MATCH: Does "high school diploma → food service
   worker" make sense? Are any described skills or knowledge inconsistent
   with this education level?

d) GEOGRAPHIC CONSISTENCY: Are all locations, establishments, and local
   references consistent with Madison, WI? (Lake Mendota, St. Maria
   Goretti, Oscar Mayer, Madison College — do these exist and make sense?)

e) CULTURAL CONSISTENCY: Is the described Italian-American Catholic
   Midwestern identity consistent with the described family structure,
   traditions, and social patterns?

Format: Same as Expert 1.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINAL SYNTHESIS:

After all 4 experts have written their observations, provide:

{
  "expert_1_psychologist": {
    "total_observations": N,
    "consistent": N,
    "inconsistent": N,
    "gaps": N,
    "critical_issues": ["issue 1", ...]
  },
  "expert_2_economist": { ... },
  "expert_3_political_scientist": { ... },
  "expert_4_demographer": { ... },
  "overall_verdict": "PASS" | "REVISE",
  "contradictions_with_seed_data": [
    "specific contradiction between interview output and NVIDIA seed"
  ],
  "suggested_revisions": [
    "specific fix to resolve each contradiction"
  ]
}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Why This Prompt Is Specific Enough

1. **Role-specific**: Each expert has their OWN domain checklist (a-d items), not generic "check for issues"
2. **Anchored to seed data**: Every expert is told to compare against the NVIDIA seed data specifically
3. **Concrete examples**: The prompt includes Mary-specific examples ("fast food worker in Madison, WI likely earns $28k-$35k")
4. **Structured output**: Each observation must reference both the seed field AND interview answer it relates to
5. **Actionable**: Output includes specific revision suggestions, not just pass/fail

### Generate Preferences

After the 4-expert verification passes, extract Mary's final preference list:

```json
{
  "food": "Midwestern classics, Italian-American home cooking",
  "cuisine_out": "Local diners, fish fry spots, farmers market vendors",
  "sports": ["Packers (NFL)", "Badgers (NCAA)", "Brewers (MLB)"],
  "music": ["John Prine", "Bon Iver", "Classic Rock"],
  "film": ["Wes Anderson films"],
  "shopping": ["Farmers market", "Trader Joe's", "REI"],
  "hobbies": ["Running", "Bullet journaling", "Gardening", "Cooking",
              "Sudoku", "Art walks", "Craft brew tastings"],
  "financial_limit": "$150/month leisure",
  "health_needs": ["Low-sodium diet (BP monitoring)", "Shellfish avoidance"],
  "religion_practice": "Sunday Mass at St. Maria Goretti",
  "career_goal": "Own a family-style diner"
}
```

# STEP 3: CREATE SOCIAL CIRCLES (5 Closest People)

## Approach: Miles' Persona-to-Persona Method

**Source:** PersonaHub paper (Tencent AI Lab, 2024) — "Scaling Synthetic Data Creation
with 1,000,000,000 Personas" (arXiv 2406.20094)

**Miles' adaptation (Meeting 3/12/26):**
Miles took the PersonaHub concept of **Persona-to-Persona generation** — where new
personas are derived from existing personas through interpersonal relationships — and
applied it to our pipeline:

1. Start with a realistic seed persona from NVIDIA (e.g., Mary Alberti)
2. Ask the LLM: **"Who is in close relationship with this persona?"**
3. The LLM generates close social circle personas (family, friends, colleagues)
   grounded in the seed persona's life context
4. These generated circle members are then used to simulate correspondence
   (messenger, calendar) in Steps 4-5

**PersonaHub's Persona-to-Persona method works by:**
- Prompting the LLM with an existing persona and asking about interpersonal relationships
- Three relationship categories: patient-caregiver, assistance, co-worker
- The paper uses 6 iterations of expansion (six degrees of separation)
- We use just 1 iteration: Mary → her 5 closest people (we don't need 6 degrees)

**Why this works better than random assignment:**
Our old approach (generate_personas.py) assigned social connections via affinity scoring
between independently-generated personas. Miles' approach generates circle members
SPECIFICALLY for each seed persona — so a food service worker in Madison, WI gets a
coworker from the same restaurant, a running buddy from the same club, family members
with consistent Italian-American background. The relationships are coherent by
construction, not by post-hoc matching.

**Miles' notes on the approach:**
- Only maintain references to users in "close_social_personas" generated via Persona-to-Persona
- Remove sub-category from static facts; remove "members" in social network
- Add "close_social_personas" field for Persona-to-Persona output
- Purpose: these defined social circles enable realistic correspondence simulation

## Thought Process

**Should parents be included?**
Yes. Mary talks to her mom "almost every day" — her mom calls on her lunch break. For a 28-year-old Italian-American Catholic woman who is unmarried and lives in the same city as her parents, family ties are central. Her mom is undeniably in her top 5.

**How rich should the descriptions be for Step 4 (messenger generation)?**
Each person needs enough detail to generate REALISTIC conversation snippets. That means:
- Their personality (are they funny? serious? supportive? critical?)
- Their shared context with Mary (what do they DO together?)
- Their communication style (text speak? full sentences? emojis? voice notes?)
- Current topics in their life (what would they be texting ABOUT this month?)

**Should we conduct interviews for each circle member too?**
Not full 30-minute interviews, but a MINI-PROFILE is needed — enough that the LLM can speak "as" that person convincingly. Think of it as a character sheet, not a full biography. Miles' Persona-to-Persona approach naturally produces these mini-profiles because the LLM generates each circle member with enough context to explain their relationship to the seed persona.

## Social Circle Generation Prompt (Persona-to-Persona)

**Based on:** PersonaHub (arXiv 2406.20094) Persona-to-Persona method,
adapted by Miles for our pipeline.

The core PersonaHub prompt is: *"Who is in close relationship with
the given persona?"* We extend this with structured output requirements
and grounding in the interview transcript.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

You are performing Persona-to-Persona generation (PersonaHub, Tencent
AI Lab 2024). Given a detailed seed persona, generate the 5 people
closest to them by deriving new personas through interpersonal
relationships.

These are the people Mary would list if asked "who are the 5 people you
talk to most?" They should come from her actual life as revealed in
the interview — family, friends, and colleagues.

MARY'S ENRICHED PERSONA (from Step 2):
{full_extracted_profile}

INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (for relationship evidence):
{interview_transcript}

REQUIREMENTS:
For each of the 5 people, provide:

1. BASIC DEMOGRAPHICS
   - Full name, age, gender, occupation, location, education
   - Relationship to Mary (mother, best friend, coworker, etc.)

2. BACKGROUND
   - How they first met Mary (or family connection)
   - How long they've known each other
   - Why they are close (shared values, shared experiences, proximity)

3. THEIR OWN PERSONALITY (mini-profile)
   - Key personality traits (enough to generate their text voice)
   - Their interests and hobbies
   - Their communication style (texts in full sentences? uses slang?
     sends memes? voice messages?)

4. SHARED ACTIVITIES WITH MARY
   - What do they DO together regularly?
   - What group activities involve them?
   - How often do they see each other / communicate?

5. RECENT TEXT TOPICS (past 2-3 months)
   - What have they been texting about?
   - Any ongoing conversations, plans, or situations?
   - Any shared concerns, jokes, or recurring themes?

CONSTRAINTS:
- These 5 people must be PLAUSIBLE given Mary's life in Madison, WI
- Their demographics must be realistic (ages, occupations, locations)
- At least 1 must be family (her mom, based on interview evidence)
- At least 1 must be a friend outside of work
- At least 1 must be a work colleague
- They should NOT all be the same age/gender/background — real social
  circles are diverse
- Their shared interests must overlap with Mary's actual interests
  from the interview

SOURCES/REASONING:
For each person, explain WHY they are in Mary's top 5 by referencing
specific evidence from the interview transcript. For example:
- "Mary said 'I talk to my mom almost every day — she calls me on my
   lunch break'" → Mom is clearly top 5
- "Mary said 'My best friend since middle school is Jess'" → Jess is
   clearly top 5

OUTPUT FORMAT:

  "social_circle": [
    {
      "name": "Full Name",
      "relationship": "mother / best friend / coworker / etc.",
      "demographics": {

## Expected Output: Mary's 5 Closest People

| # | Name | Relationship | Why Top 5 |
|---|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Rosa Alberti** (age 56) | Mother | "I talk to my mom almost every day — she calls me on my lunch break" |
| 2 | **Jessica Torres** (age 28) | Best friend / roommate | "My best friend since middle school is Jess... we run together 3 mornings a week" |
| 3 | **Danny Kowalski** (age 31) | Coworker | "My coworker Danny... he's like a brother to me at work" |
| 4 | **Tony Alberti** (age 32) | Brother | "My brother Tony, we're close... comes back for Packers games" |
| 5 | **Lisa Chen** (age 30) | Running club friend | From Madison Runners Club — someone Mary sees 3x/week who isn't Jess |

## Verification: Are the 5 circles consistent with Step 2?

Check:
- Does each person's profile align with Mary's described relationships in the interview?
- Are shared activities consistent with Mary's actual interests and schedule?
- Are locations all Madison-area (except Tony in Milwaukee)?
- Do any circle members contradict Mary's values, lifestyle, or constraints?

# STEP 4: SYNTHESIZE MESSENGER LOGS

## References
- **SimsChat** ("Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs"): Multi-turn dialogue generation with personality-consistent characters in specified scenes
- **PICLe** ("Persona In-Context Learning"): Selecting examples that maximally distinguish a persona from the average
- **SPP** ("Solo Performance Prompting"): Multi-persona self-collaboration within a single LLM call
- **Sequential-NIAH**: Inserting "needles" (hidden facts) into long contexts for extraction testing

## Design: Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Generate 2-6 Turn Conversation Snippets with Implicit Preferences

For each of Mary's 5 circle members, generate conversation snippets where Mary's preferences are **implicitly revealed** (never stated directly).

**Reference: Sequential-NIAH Needle Types**

The Sequential-NIAH paper defines three types of needles:
- **Synthetic temporal order needles**: Facts with timestamps arranged chronologically (e.g., diary entries about events on specific dates)
- **Real temporal order needles**: Events that naturally occur in sequence (e.g., "doctor said BP was high" → "started cutting salt" → "BP better at follow-up")
- **Real logical order needles**: Facts that follow a logical sequence (e.g., "allergic to shellfish" → "avoids seafood restaurants" → "brings own food to fish fry")

**For our messenger logs, we need ALL THREE types:**

| Needle Type | Example for Mary | How It Appears in Messenger |
|---|---|---|
| **Synthetic temporal** | Health checkup on Feb 3 → Salt reduction starts Feb 5 → Mentions feeling better Feb 20 | Mary texts mom: "doc appointment went ok" (Feb 3) → texts Jess: "trying this low-sodium thing, any good recipes?" (Feb 5) → texts mom: "numbers are looking better!" (Feb 20) |
| **Real temporal** | Career progression: applied for supervisor role → interview → waiting for response | Mary texts Danny: "finally submitted the application" → "interview is Thursday wish me luck" → "still haven't heard back ugh" |
| **Real logical** | Shellfish allergy chain: can't eat shrimp → avoids seafood restaurants → brings own dish to parish fish fry | Mary texts Jess: "can we NOT do Red Lobster for your birthday lol" → texts mom: "I'll bring my own thing to the fish fry again" |

### Snippet Generation Prompt

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

You are generating realistic text message conversation snippets between
Mary Alberti and one of her closest circle members. Each snippet should
be 2-6 turns and should IMPLICITLY reveal one of Mary's preferences or
hidden facts through natural conversation — never stating it directly.

MARY'S FULL PERSONA:
{step2_enriched_persona}

CONVERSATION PARTNER:
{circle_member_full_profile from Step 3}

MARY'S PREFERENCES/FACTS TO EMBED (pick 1-2 per snippet):
{list_of_preferences_and_hidden_facts}

GENERATION RULES:

1. IMPLICIT REVELATION ONLY
   The preference must emerge naturally from context, NOT be stated.
   ✅ Mary: "Can we do somewhere other than Red Lobster? Last time I
       had a bad reaction and I really don't want to risk it"
   ❌ Mary: "I can't go there because I'm allergic to shellfish"

   ✅ Mary: "Omg the Packers game yesterday!! Did you see that
       fourth quarter comeback??"
   ❌ Mary: "As a Packers fan, I enjoyed the game"

2. VOICE CONSISTENCY
   - Mary (28, HS education, food service, Midwestern): Uses casual
     texting language, occasional "lol" and "omg," avoids academic
     vocabulary, Midwestern politeness ("oh for sure," "you betcha")
   - Each circle member has THEIR OWN voice based on their mini-profile
   - Texts between close friends are different from texts with mom
     (more slang with friends, more respectful with mom)

3. CONVERSATION MUST FEEL REAL
   - Include small talk, emoji, reactions, topic changes
   - Reference shared experiences and inside jokes
   - Include planning logistics (times, places, "you free Saturday?")
   - Not every message needs to carry a hidden fact — some are just
     normal conversation that makes the hidden facts blend in

4. TEMPORAL MARKERS
   - Each snippet should have a rough date (within the past 2-3 months)
   - Snippets with the same person should show chronological progression
   - Events referenced should be consistent across all conversations
     (if Mary mentions "the parish fish fry" to mom, she shouldn't
     contradict the date when talking to Jess about it)

5. NEEDLE INSERTION STRATEGY (from Sequential-NIAH):
   For each hidden fact, create a chain of 2-3 messages across
   DIFFERENT conversations that form a temporal or logical sequence:

   TEMPORAL CHAIN example (health):
     Feb 3, to Mom: "just got out of the doctor, she wants me to
       watch my salt intake more"
     Feb 10, to Jess: "hey do you know any good low-sodium recipes?
       trying to cook healthier"
     Feb 22, to Mom: "went back for the follow-up, numbers are better!
       that low sodium thing is actually working"

   LOGICAL CHAIN example (shellfish allergy):
     To Jess: "can we not do seafood for girls night? my stomach does
       NOT agree with that stuff"
     To Mom: "I'll bring the pasta salad to the fish fry instead of
       eating the fish this year"
     To Danny: "one of the customers ordered the shrimp basket and
       just the SMELL made me feel weird lol"

GENERATE 3-5 CONVERSATION SNIPPETS (2-6 turns each) for Mary and
this specific circle member. Each snippet should embed 1-2 preferences.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "conversation_partner": "Name",
  "snippets": [
    {
      "date": "2026-01-XX",
      "embedded_facts": ["fact being implicitly revealed"],
      "needle_type": "synthetic_temporal | real_temporal | real_logical",
      "messages": [
        {"sender": "Mary", "text": "message text", "time": "HH:MM"},
        {"sender": "Partner", "text": "response", "time": "HH:MM"},
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Phase 2: Merge Snippets into Long History

After generating 3-5 snippets per circle member (15-25 total snippets), merge them into a single long chronological message history per relationship.

**Reference: Sequential-NIAH insertion algorithm:**
1. Take the long "haystack" (normal conversation filler)
2. Insert "needle" snippets at random positions within the timeline
3. The needles should be scattered, not clustered — mimicking how real preferences emerge over weeks of texting

```
Merging Strategy:
1. Sort all snippets by date across all 5 circle members
2. Add "filler" messages between snippets (logistics, memes, reactions
   to shared events, "running tomorrow?", "what time is your shift?")
3. The filler makes the needle-facts harder to find — just like real
   text history where important information is buried in small talk
4. Final output: one long JSON array per relationship, chronological
```

### Step 4 Verification Prompt

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

You are verifying synthesized messenger logs for consistency with the
persona (Step 2) and social circles (Step 3). Check each of the following:

MARY'S PERSONA (from Step 2):
{step2_enriched_persona}

SOCIAL CIRCLES (from Step 3):
{step3_five_people}

MESSENGER LOGS TO VERIFY:
{generated_messenger_logs}

VERIFICATION CHECKS:

1. PERSONA CONSISTENCY
   - Does Mary's texting voice match her profile? (28, HS education,
     Midwestern, food service worker)
   - Are her described interests, preferences, and habits reflected
     in her messages?
   - Does she EVER directly state a hidden fact that should be implicit?
     (If she texts "I have hypertension" — that's a FAIL)

2. RELATIONSHIP CONSISTENCY
   - Does the tone with each person match the relationship?
     (Warmer with mom, more casual with Jess, work-focused with Danny)
   - Are shared activities mentioned in messages consistent with the
     shared activities listed in Step 3?
   - Does Mary ever text someone about something they wouldn't know
     about or care about?

3. TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY
   - Do needle chains follow correct chronological order?
   - Are there any contradictions between what Mary tells different
     people about the same event?
   - Do dates and times make sense? (No texting at 3 AM for someone
     who wakes at 5:45 AM)

4. NEEDLE INTEGRITY
   - Can you identify each embedded preference/fact from the messages
     alone (without seeing the persona profile)?
   - Are the needles indirect enough? (The reader should be able to
     INFER the fact, but it should never be STATED)
   - Are needle chains complete? (Each hidden fact should have 2-3
     message references across different conversations)

5. NATURALNESS
   - Do the conversations feel like real text exchanges between
     people who know each other well?
   - Is there enough mundane/filler content that the needles don't
     stand out as obviously planted?
   - Do both sides of the conversation feel like real people? (Not
     just Mary talking AT someone)

OUTPUT:
{
  "check_1_persona": {"verdict": "PASS|FAIL", "issues": [...]},
  "check_2_relationship": {"verdict": "PASS|FAIL", "issues": [...]},
  "check_3_temporal": {"verdict": "PASS|FAIL", "issues": [...]},

# STEP 5: SYNTHESIZE CALENDAR LOGS

## Design

Generate 2-3 months of calendar entries for Mary that naturally reflect her preferences, routines, and social life — WITHOUT including trivial routine tasks.

### Calendar Generation Prompt

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

You are generating realistic calendar entries for Mary Alberti over the
past 2-3 months (December 2025 — February 2026). These entries should
reflect her actual life: work schedule, social plans, health appointments,
hobbies, and recurring commitments.

MARY'S PERSONA (from Step 2):
{step2_enriched_persona}

SOCIAL CIRCLES (from Step 3):
{step3_five_people}

GENERATION RULES:

1. WHAT GOES ON A CALENDAR (include):
   - Work shifts (she works variable schedules in food service)
   - Social plans with specific people ("Dinner at Mom & Dad's",
     "Running with Jess", "Packers game at Danny's")
   - Appointments ("Dr. Chen follow-up", "ServSafe study session")
   - Special events ("Parish Fish Fry", "Badgers game", "Art walk downtown")
   - Recurring commitments ("Mass - St. Maria Goretti", "Running club")
   - One-off plans ("Tony visiting for Packers game", "Craft brew tasting")

2. WHAT DOES NOT GO ON A CALENDAR (exclude):
   - Routine daily tasks: "breakfast," "shower," "drive to work"
   - Things everyone does: "sleep," "lunch," "check phone"
   - Vague intentions: "relax," "free time"
   These would make the calendar unrealistic — real people only
   calendar-block things that need scheduling.

3. PREFERENCE MAPPING:
   Every preference from Mary's profile should appear in at least one
   calendar entry:
   - Sports teams → game watch entries (Packers Sundays, Brewers games,
     Badgers basketball)
   - Running → recurring "Lake Mendota run" or "Running Club"
   - Cooking → "Dinner party," "Meal prep Sunday"
   - Gardening → "Garden center trip," "Seed starting"
   - Religion → "Mass" recurring Sundays
   - Health → "Dr. appointment," "BP check" (without naming condition)
   - Career → "ServSafe study," "Hospitality program info session"
   - Financial → "Budget review" (she's a bullet journaler)

4. SOCIAL CIRCLE INTEGRATION:
   - Each of the 5 circle members should appear in at least 2-3
     calendar entries
   - Mom: Sunday dinners, calls (not on calendar — too routine),
     but special occasions yes ("Mom's birthday dinner")
   - Jess: Running, girls' nights, shared apartment things
   - Danny: Work shifts overlap, occasional hangout
   - Tony: Monthly visits from Milwaukee
   - Lisa: Running club, occasional coffee

5. NATURALNESS CHECK:
   - Vary the density: some weeks are busy, some are quiet
   - Include cancellations or reschedules (real life)
   - Holiday-specific entries (Christmas, New Year's, Super Bowl)
   - Weather-dependent adjustments (indoor run vs. Lake Mendota in Jan)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "calendar_entries": [
    {
      "date": "2026-01-05",
      "time": "09:00",
      "duration_minutes": 60,
      "title": "Lake Mendota Run w/ Jess & Lisa",
      "location": "Lake Mendota path",
      "notes": "3 miles, dress warm",
      "category": "fitness",
      "people_involved": ["Jessica Torres", "Lisa Chen"],
      "preferences_reflected": ["Running", "Madison Runners Club"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Generate 40-60 entries spanning December 2025 through February 2026.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 5 Verification Prompt

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

Verify the synthesized calendar entries for consistency with Mary's
persona (Step 2) and social circles (Step 3).

CHECKS:

1. PREFERENCE COVERAGE
   - List every preference from Mary's profile
   - For each, check: does it appear in at least one calendar entry?
   - Score: X out of Y preferences represented

2. PERSONA CONSISTENCY
   - Do work shift times match a food service schedule? (not 9-5)
   - Do social activities match her personality? (not 5 parties/week
     for a routine-focused person)
   - Are health appointments present without naming conditions?
   - Are financial activities present? (budget review, diner research)

3. SOCIAL CIRCLE CONSISTENCY
   - Does each of the 5 circle members appear in calendar entries?
   - Are the activities they share consistent with Step 3 descriptions?
   - Are there any entries with people NOT in her social circle
     without explanation?

4. NATURALNESS
   - Are there any routine tasks that real people don't calendar?
     ("Breakfast" = FAIL)
   - Is the density realistic? (Not 5 events every day)
   - Are there any temporal impossibilities? (Two events at same time,
     running at midnight)
   - Do seasonal patterns make sense? (No outdoor garden work in
     Wisconsin in January)

5. CROSS-CHECK WITH MESSENGER
   - Do any plans mentioned in messenger logs (Step 4) appear on the
     calendar?
   - Are there contradictions? (Messenger says "girls night Saturday"
     but calendar shows she's working)

OUTPUT: Same verification format as Step 4.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# STEP 6: EVALUATE COVERAGE

## Goal
Rate how much of Mary's persona and each social circle member's characteristics are reflected in the messenger logs AND calendar events combined. Our ultimate goal: **Given ONLY the app logs, an LLM should be able to understand the persona and their relationships.**

### Evaluation Prompt

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM:

You are evaluating the completeness and quality of synthesized app logs
(messenger + calendar) for the persona Mary Alberti.

YOUR TASK: Given ONLY the app logs below (no persona profile, no social
circle descriptions), rate how well an LLM could reconstruct each aspect
of Mary's life.

APP LOGS ONLY (this is all you get):
{messenger_logs_all_5_relationships}
{calendar_entries}

EVALUATION RUBRIC:

For each category below, rate 1-5:
  5 = Clearly inferable from app logs alone
  4 = Strongly suggested, minor ambiguity
  3 = Partially suggested, requires inference
  2 = Weakly hinted, easy to miss
  1 = Not present in app logs at all

CATEGORY A: PERSONA PREFERENCES
Rate each of Mary's known preferences:
| Preference | Rating | Evidence in Logs |
|---|---|---|
| Food preference (Midwestern/Italian) | ? | "quote from logs" |
| Sports teams (Packers/Badgers/Brewers) | ? | "quote" |
| Music (John Prine, Bon Iver) | ? | "quote" |
| Hobbies (running, gardening, journaling) | ? | "quote" |
| Shopping (farmers market, REI, TJ's) | ? | "quote" |
| Career goal (diner ownership) | ? | "quote" |
| Religion (Catholic, Sunday Mass) | ? | "quote" |
| Political leaning | ? | "quote" |

CATEGORY B: HIDDEN FACTS (NEEDLES)
| Hidden Fact | Rating | Evidence Chain |
|---|---|---|
| Borderline hypertension | ? | "message 1" → "message 2" → "calendar entry" |
| Shellfish allergy/sensitivity | ? | "message 1" → "message 2" |
| Financial constraint ($150/mo) | ? | "message 1" → "calendar: budget review" |
| Personal conflict (former coworker) | ? | "message reference" |

CATEGORY C: SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS
For each of the 5 circle members:
| Person | Relationship Type Inferable? | Closeness Level Inferable? | Their Personality Visible? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rosa (mom) | ? | ? | ? |
| Jess (best friend) | ? | ? | ? |
| Danny (coworker) | ? | ? | ? |
| Tony (brother) | ? | ? | ? |
| Lisa (running friend) | ? | ? | ? |

CATEGORY D: 4 EXPERT PERSPECTIVES
Re-evaluate from each expert's lens:

PSYCHOLOGIST: Can Mary's personality traits (routine-obsessed,
  competitive edge, disciplined, agreeable) be inferred from logs?
  Rating: ? Evidence: "..."

BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIST: Can Mary's financial situation, spending
  patterns, and career ambitions be inferred from logs?
  Rating: ? Evidence: "..."

POLITICAL SCIENTIST: Can Mary's civic engagement and political
  stance be inferred from logs?
  Rating: ? Evidence: "..."

DEMOGRAPHER: Can Mary's demographic profile (age, education,
  occupation, location, cultural background) be inferred from logs?
  Rating: ? Evidence: "..."

OVERALL SCORES:
{
  "persona_preference_coverage": "X/Y preferences scored 4+",
  "needle_discovery_rate": "X/Y hidden facts scored 4+",
  "relationship_clarity": "X/5 relationships clearly inferable",
  "expert_confidence": {
    "psychologist": "N/5",
    "economist": "N/5",
    "political_scientist": "N/5",
    "demographer": "N/5"
  },
  "overall_app_log_quality": "N/5",
  "gaps_to_fix": [
    "preference/fact not reflected in any log",
    "relationship not distinguishable from logs"
  ]

# DESIGN DECISIONS SUMMARY

## Step-by-Step Overview

| Step | Output | Key Design Decision |
|---|---|---|
| **1. NVIDIA Seed** | Mary Alberti's 10 narrative fields | Census-aligned PGM ensures joint distribution correctness across demographics |
| **2. Interview** | 12 questions totaling 30 min from Table 7 | Paper shows 20% of interview time is sufficient; questions selected for diverse domain coverage |
| **3. Verification** | 4 expert views with structured observations | Each expert has domain-specific checklist anchored to seed data (ref Table 11) |
| **4. Social Circles** | 5 people with evidence from interview | Each person has a mini-profile rich enough to generate their text voice |
| **5. Messenger** | 19 snippets across 5 conversations with needles | Sequential-NIAH needle types: synthetic temporal, real temporal, real logical |
| **6. Calendar** | 47 entries, no routine tasks | Every preference mapped to at least one entry; cross-checked with messenger |
| **7. Test Cases** | 75 evaluation test cases with evidence | 4 types: simple fact-check, cross-log, dynamic preference, reasoning |

## Key Design Rationale

**Interview scope (12 of 99 questions):** Park et al. showed 20% of interview time captures enough for an enriched persona. We selected questions covering all domains needed for downstream steps (social, health, religion, finances, daily routine). More questions risk contradictions with diminishing returns.

**Social circle depth:** Full 30-minute interviews for each circle member would be 5x the cost for diminishing returns. Mini-profiles with personality traits, communication style, and shared context are sufficient to generate convincing messenger conversations.

**Needle insertion strategy:** Three needle types from Sequential-NIAH ensure comprehensive evaluation: synthetic temporal needles test chronological extraction, real temporal needles test cause-effect understanding (doctor visit -> diet change -> improvement), and real logical needles test inference (shellfish avoidance across multiple contexts -> allergy). Each hidden fact gets 2-3 messages scattered across different conversations.

**Persona-to-Persona vs independent generation:** Independent generation creates personas and matches them into relationships via post-hoc affinity scoring. Persona-to-Persona (Miles' approach) generates circle members specifically from each seed persona, so relationships are coherent by construction.

**Text-to-Persona and Persona-to-Persona:** Both PersonaHub methods are used sequentially. Text-to-Persona (Steps 1-2) derives the enriched persona from NVIDIA narrative text. Persona-to-Persona (Step 3) expands the persona into a social circle. See `step3_social_circles/text_to_persona_method.md`.
